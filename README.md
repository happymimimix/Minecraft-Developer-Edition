# Minecraft-Developer-Edition
WARNING! 
You are about to install a leaked internal developer edition of Minecraft 1.19.60.22! 

This special edition of Minecraft contains a lot of interesting debugging tools that you can play around with. But also come with certain limitations: 
First of all, you cannot play on almost all the multiplayer servers. 
It will either say outdated client or outdated server! 
But you can build your own multiplayer server specially for this internal developer edition. 
The files you need can be found in AdditionalComponents.zip on your desktop. 
Besides, this bug has a lot of games! 
Although this is already one of the most stable dev versions, it still crashes very often. 
Because it's a developer edition anyway. In other words, beta version. 
A public release without the debugging tools would probably be better for daily usage. 

Before you continue: 
1. Please make sure your device can play the public commercial version of minecraft normally before trying out this internal developer edition! 
2. If you have minecraft UWP installed already, please uninstall first before continue. 
3. Developer mode must be turned on on your device to be able to install this package successfully. 
To turn on developer mode, go to Settings -> Update and Security -> For Developers -> Developer Mode
